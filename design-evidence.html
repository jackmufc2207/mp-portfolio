            <h3>Colour Theory</h3>
            <p>Colour theory is the science and the art of exploiting colours. It clarifies how we as humans perceive colour; and the visualisation of how colours combine, match or juxtapose each other. (Howard Bear, 2020) Colour theory additionally involves the connotations that colours represent; at one end of the scale, you have colours that promote coldness and the other end you have warmth for example. So, the way that we interpret colours is taken into context when doing photoshoots; what feeling are you trying to convey with the photographs and what colours and tones would be best to express that feeling.
Impartial colours such as blacks, whites, greys, and browns make for great backdrops, and may often be used as a standalone colour as the only or primary focus of a design.
Adjacent colours appear next to each other on the colour wheel and these often work well together for example using maroon, red and ruby red.
Contrasting colours are divided by other colours—they come from different fragments of the colour wheel. The further they are away from one colour, the more the contrast.
Complementary colours are colours that complement each other despite being on conflicting sides of the colour wheel. E.g., yellow is a complementary colour to blue, green may complement pink.

            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>Typography is the ability to coordinate letters and words in such a way that makes the print clear, comprehendible and visually appealing to the reader. Typography involves font style, façade, and structure, which aims to provoke specific emotions and convey specific messages. (Hannah, 2020) Good typography will determine a solid visual hierarchy, offer a graphic balance to the portfolio/website, and set the product’s complete quality. Typography should direct and enlighten your users, enhance accessibility, and guarantee a good customer experience.
Your website users may even subconsciously start to liken the typography presented with your whole brand. Having your own style of typography will be beneficial to you when forming a resilient following; this helps to build a relationship of trust with your site users, which will be very advantageous to you if you become associated with professionalism.
Choosing between fonts for a project can be quite difficult given that there are such a vast range of choices as fonts can refer to all different the widths and styles that constitute a typeface, like serif/sans-serif (with/without serif) for example.

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>Accessibility is the exercise of building your websites to be as usable by as many users as possible. The practice of making you website accessible means making the site available to users who may be visiting the site on a different device.
Accessibility is not only important, but it is also considered the right thing to do. You want your site to be available to anyone, so you should try to cater for all kinds of people whether they have visual/hearing impairments, mobility impairments or cognitive deficiencies such as mental illness or learning disabilities, as well as people with no access to a laptop/PC.  Delivering accessible websites is part of the law in some places, which can open up some substantial markets that otherwise would not be able to use your services or buy your products. In the modern world, we use a variety of tools to help us bypass our impairments. Glasses to improve vision, hearing aids to increase hearing volume, wheelchairs to increase mobility etc. (Duggin, 2016) This is also true online. Browsers provide settings to increase font size and colours so people can make text more legible. Screen magnifiers allows us to make interfaces even bigger, and there are tons of other accessibility options to optimise a user’s experience regardless of who they are.
