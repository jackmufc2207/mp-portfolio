      <h3>Photography Basics</h3>
      <p>Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, to create a still image.

One of the three most important settings in photography is Shutter Speed, the other two being Aperture and ISO.

Shutter speed is vital for two specific things: changing the brightness of your picture and also creating dramatic effects by either freezing or smearing. Shutter speed is effectively, the amount of time the camera shutter is open and exposing light onto the sensor. Essentially, it’s how long your camera spends taking a photo.

The “pupil” of your lens is called aperture. You can shrink or expand the size of the aperture to allow different levels of light to reach your sensor. (Mansurov, 2019)
Aperture can add dimensions to your images by adjusting the depth of field. At one end, aperture provides you with a blurry background with a nice insubstantial focus effect, at the other, it will give you sharper pictures from the foreground to the distant skyline.
ISO is a setting that will brighten or darken an image. If you increase your ISO number, your photos will become increasingly brighter. Because of this, ISO allows you to seize images in obscurer environments. Nonetheless, raising your ISO has its cons. If the ISO is too high, it will show a lot of grain which it’s unlikely you would want that. You should only raise your ISO when you are unable to brighten the photo via shutter speed or aperture.

      <h3>Video Production Basics</h3>
      <p>Video production has more aspects to take into account than a still image. You need to consider audio and production quality as well as casting, story boarding, planning, voiceovers, editing etc. (Foust, Fink and Gross, 2017)
This was something we had to focus on when filming our project for MOTDx. We realised after filming pieces to camera outside, that the microphone picks up so much noise that you need to plan a good time to film where there will be minimal distractions in the audio. As well as audio, you to take into account the mise-en-scene. Think about how you want to frame the person/object of significant, where will you got to film? Is it accessible? where do you want to position the camera, do you need a tripod, or will you film freehand? These are all examples of questions you should be prepared for before even trying to attempt filming. You may well be surprised at how much better you clips turn out in the editing stage if you plan your entire filming process.

      <h3>Social Media Delivery</h3>
      <p>The delivery of a social media piece fluctuates in comparison to video production or a photograph, a social media piece is mainly used to promote your final production of something. (Vaughan, 2020)
To do this you would either use a snippet of an exciting moment in your project or even an unused clip that was entertaining but maybe didn’t make the final cut. The snippet would then be posted all your brands social media sites or maybe just one or two specific sites depending on which you think your target demographic uses most and this will encourage the audience to click the link and watch the full version of your video. The social media clip essentially becomes a mini trailer for the show you’re trying to promote. So, for example, with our social media clip, we decided to upload ours to TikTok because it’s become increasingly popular over the last year or so and is used mainly by the 16-24 year old demographic which falls into our target market so we think this will give our product the best outreach.
